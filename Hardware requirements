1x Arduino Pro Micro Controller
6x cherry mx switch (or just any switch really)
4x normal keycaps (the ones you find on wasd and not space bar or shift)
2x shift keycaps
1x pcb (depending on the size of your controller)
2x rotary encoder (my circuit doesnt use the ones with expansion PCBs but if you have those the code will work just fine)
1x usb micro to usb 2.0/3.0 cable with data transfer
